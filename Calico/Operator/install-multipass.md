Installing the Lab Orchestrator

To begin we will be installing Multipass. Multipass is a utility from Canonical that allows you to create Ubuntu VMs across a range of platforms in a uniform fashion. We recommend using the latest stable version of Multipass (version 1.4.0 at the time of writing). If any difficulty is encountered deploying the labs - please try this version of Multipass and let us know in the #academy slack channel that you encountered issues with a newer version.

Multipass installation instructions can be found here: https://multipass.run

Note: If you're running on Windows, you must use the default Hyper-V option.  In addition, note that if you are running an old version of VMware Workstation/Player on Windows, you may find that VMware can not start VMs after using multipass due to its use of Hyper-V. If you experience this, please see the workaround instructions later in the "Managing Your Lab" module.

Restart your workstation after installing Multipass and before installing the lab.
