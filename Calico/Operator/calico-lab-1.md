Installing Calico for the Lab

We will be using the Tigera Operator to install and configure Calico.

If you are not already on host1, you can enter host1 by using the multipass shell command.
```
multipass shell host1
```
The command below will install the operator onto our lab kubernetes cluster:
```
kubectl create -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/archive/v3.16/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
```
Validating the Operator installation

Following the operator being installed, we will validate that the operator is running:
```
kubectl get pods -n tigera-operator
```
The output from this command should indicate that the operator pod is running:
```
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tigera-operator-64f448dfb9-d2fdq   1/1     Running   0          2m33s
```
Installing Calico

After the operator is in a Running state, we will configure an Installation kind for Calico, specifying the IP Pool that we would like below.

Note that throughout the course we make use of inline manifests (piping stdin to kubectl) to make it easier for you to follow what each manifest does. In most cases it would be a more normal practice to use a vanilla kubectl command with a manifest file (e.g. kubectl apply -f my-installation.yaml).  We recommend taking a minute to read through and make sure you understand the contents of each manifest we apply in this way throughout the rest of the course to get the most out of each example.
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation

  name: default
spec:
  calicoNetwork:
    containerIPForwarding: Enabled
    ipPools:
    - cidr: 198.19.16.0/21
      natOutgoing: Enabled
      encapsulation: None
EOF
```
Validating the Calico installation

Following the configuration of the installation resource, Calico will begin deploying onto your cluster. This can be validated by running the following command:
```
kubectl get tigerastatus/calico
The output from the command when the installation is complete is:

NAME     AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
calico   True        False         False      10m
```
We can review the environment now by invoking:
```
kubectl get pods -A
Example output:

Reviewing Calico pods
```
Let's take a look at the Calico pods that have been installed by the operator.
```
kubectl get pods -n calico-system
Example Output:

NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
calico-typha-5d788c654b-56wp9              1/1     Running   0          4h28m
calico-node-2bkv5                          1/1     Running   0          4h28m
calico-kube-controllers-5dcfdbc5f4-vpgx5   1/1     Running   0          4h28m
calico-node-8465h                          1/1     Running   0          4h26m
calico-typha-5d788c654b-wn7gf              1/1     Running   0          4h24m
calico-node-qmq5j                          1/1     Running   0          3h57m
calico-typha-5d788c654b-rd8kl              1/1     Running   0          3h56m
```
From here we can see that there are different pods that are deployed.

calico-node: Calico-node runs on every Kubernetes cluster node as a DaemonSet. It is responsible for enforcing network policy, setting up routes on the nodes, plus managing any virtual interfaces for IPIP, VXLAN, or WireGuard.
calico-typha: Typha is as a stateful proxy for the Kubernetes API server. It's used by every calico-node pod to query and watch Kubernetes resources without putting excessive load on the Kubernetes API server.  The Tigera Operator automatically scales the number of Typha instances as the cluster size grows.
calico-kube-controllers: Runs a variety of Calico specific controllers that automate synchronization of resources. For example, when a Kubernetes node is deleted, it tidies up any IP addresses or other Calico resources associated with the node.
Reviewing Node Health

Finally, we can review the health of our Kubernetes nodes by invoking the kubectl command.

kubectl get nodes -A
Example output:

NAME      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
control   Ready    master   37m   v1.18.10+k3s1
node2     Ready    <none>   16m   v1.18.10+k3s1
node1     Ready    <none>   31m   v1.18.10+k3s1
Now we can see that our Kubernetes nodes have a status of Ready and are operational. Calico is now installed on your cluster and you may proceed to the next module: Installing the Sample Application.
